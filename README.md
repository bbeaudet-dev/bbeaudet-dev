## Hi there, I'm Ben 👋

Mechanical engineer turned aspiring software engineer with a dream of indie game development

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... preparing for the summer cohort of the Fractal Bootcamp; starting a portfolio of applications/projects (counter, scoreboard, personal site, Blackjack)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... fullstack development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Typescript)
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... pivoting to software engineering from mechanical engineeering (or another technical background)
- 🕹️ I’m playing ... Balatro, Opus Magnum, Celeste (trying to 100%), & Factorio (and waiting patiently for Subnautica 2 and HK Silksong)
