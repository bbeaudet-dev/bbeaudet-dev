## Hi there, I'm Ben 👋

Mechanical engineer turned aspiring software engineer with a dream of indie game development

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... fullstack development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, MongoDB, Typescript)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... preparing for Fractal Tech's bootcamp; starting a portfolio of simple applications/projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... pivoting to software engineering from mechanical engineeering (or other technical background)
- 🕹️ I’m playing ... Balatro and Celeste (trying to 100% both), Opus Magnum (highly recommend for any programmer), and waiting patiently for Subnautica 2 and Hollow Knight: Silksong
