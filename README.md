## Hi there 👋

I'm Ben!  
I'm a mechanical engineer turned aspiring software engineer who loves building cool things and solving difficult problems.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ... recreating simple games (e.g. Hangman, Wordle) in VBA, building workplace productivity tools, and automating design work in CAD
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... introductions to full stack development, Javascript, and Typescript; advanced VBA
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ... transitioning from mechanical engineeering to software engineering
- 🕹️ I’m playing ... Factorio, Pokemon ROM Hacks, Plate Up (and looking forward to Subnautica 2 and Hollow Knight Silksong)
- 💬 Ask me about ... what I love to work on and where I see myself in 10 years
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I've played the piano since I was 6 years old and I am visiting all of the National Parks!
